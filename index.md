### About Me

[CV](./assets/ps03.pdf)

I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying molecular & cell biology and mathematics. Aside from academics, I'm into running, spelunking, and French people who wrote some cool stuff (e.g. Foucault <3).

Saunders Mac Lane, a mathematician deeply involved in the creation of category theory, once described his work as "abstract nonsense." I think I fall roughly in the same boat as far as my specific interests but with some hope of ultimate salvation.

I'm interested in algebraic topology and its applications in data analysis, especially in the realm of neuroscience. This includes machinery developed for studying structural features of data, such as persistent homology, as well as theoretical considerations and limitations arising in commonly used methods (e.g I love [this piece](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/)). In the biological realm, I'm fascinated by brain oscillations and their circuit and cellular origins. I currently work in the Knight Lab as an undergraduate research assistant where I'm studying top-down control of sensory and motor systems.
